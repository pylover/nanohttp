## Contribution


### Branching

A new branching model is applied to this repository, which consists of a 
master branch and release branches.

#### Master branch

The master branch is an integration branch where bug fixes/features are 
gathered for compiling and functional testing.

#### Release branch

The release branch is where releases are maintained and hot fixes 
(with names like release/v2.x.x) are added. Please ensure that all your 
production-related work are tracked with the release branches.

With this new model, we can push out bug fixes more quickly and achieve 
simpler maintenance.
